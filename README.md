# Next.js 15 App Router: Link Component Issue in Dynamically Rendered Components

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Next.js 15's App Router related to the `Link` component within dynamically rendered components.  The `Link` component fails to function correctly when the component containing it is dynamically generated or imported during runtime.

## Bug Description
The issue is observed when using `next/link` inside a component that's rendered conditionally or fetched asynchronously.  The generated link might not behave as expected. It may not navigate correctly to the target route, potentially resulting in a broken navigation experience.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Observe that the links in the dynamically generated sections of the page do not work as intended.  

## Solution
The solution provided addresses the routing issue by ensuring the `Link` component is re-rendered correctly when the dynamic component is updated.
